<!-- lordhelpmex200.html*** this will update the price of the big salad but will no longer work for the small salad. Back logging both but combining instead of adding the two together. I just found a simple video that adds two numbers together. Can I get enough information to figure this out or not...I think it is because it is treating the numbers as strings instead of numbers. I have been making changes, making changes, trying something different and nothing will work....Why you ask? Because yesterday, I went back to one that did work and that is the one on the f**king screen, not the one I have made the changes to!!!!!-->
