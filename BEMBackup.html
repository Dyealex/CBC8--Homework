            <p class="card__text">I'm getting hungry if it fits i sits. Purr when eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. Get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper at four in the morning wake up owner meeeeeeooww scratch at legs and beg for food then cry and yowl until they wake up at two pm jump on window and sleep while observing the bootyful cat next door that u really like but who already has a boyfriend</p>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="card__text"> Unwrap toilet paper ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside so missing until dinner time, for cat snacks, going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today. Reaches under door into adjacent room.  If human is on laptop sit on the keyboard dead stare with ears cocked give me attention or face the wrath of my claws meow meow, i tell my human touch water with paw then recoil in horror. Run in circles find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out.</p>

Unwrap toilet paper ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside so missing until dinner time, for cat snacks, going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today. Reaches under door into adjacent room eat all the power cords. If human is on laptop sit on the keyboard dead stare with ears cocked give me attention or face the wrath of my claws meow meow, i tell my human touch water with paw then recoil in horror. Run in circles find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out cough hairball on conveniently placed pants proudly present butt to human but love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater).</p>
